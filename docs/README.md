# docs

Project documentation and planning area for the Delivery MVP.

## Key references

- `CONSTRAINTS.md` — project constraints and architecture guardrails.
- `MVP_TICKETS.md` — backlog and ticket status.

## Purpose

Keep documents close to implementation while reflecting current scope:

- Setup and environment assumptions
- API/backend decisions
- Mobile app conventions
- Deployment notes (as tickets progress)

## Ticketing

- Only one ticket is implemented per run by design.
- This directory can be used to track design rationale and decision log for later tickets.
