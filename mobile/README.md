# mobile

Mobile application for the Delivery MVP.

## Tech stack

- Expo (React Native)
- TypeScript
- Role-based screens and auth flows planned (USER, DRIVER, OPS_ADMIN, SYS_ADMIN)
- No local Docker requirement for app development

## Local setup

1. Install Node.js (LTS) and Expo tooling (`npm install -g expo-cli` if preferred).
2. Install dependencies for the mobile project.
3. Configure API endpoint settings in an environment file for the target backend.

## Development commands

- Start Metro/dev client as generated per ticket implementation (`npx expo start` when initialized).
- Mobile functionality will be added in subsequent tickets.
